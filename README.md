## Project management

With three people working at the project some structure was necessary. To create an overview we used zenhub as a tool. Zenhub is a project management tool that can be compared to any other tool like trello or Jira, but the reason why we chose this tool is because it uses github issues. This way we can update our project board by just commiting our solution with the ticket name and this automaticly updates the zenhub board.
