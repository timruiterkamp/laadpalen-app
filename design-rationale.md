# Design rationale

## test the build 2

## Introduction

We are working together on creating an app for aswell servering the eletric car driver as the operator of the charging station.

The charging station has different kind of stakeholders all serving a different point in the story.

We are building a proof of concept to show what is possible as a user to get the right help. Aswell for people operating the charging station.

## Investigation

### Case

When 2030 hits in Amsterdam not all diesel and gasoline cars don't have acces anymore to the ring. So there will be alot of eletric cars coming in the near future. The thing with eletric cars is that you can only charge them at a charging station. So they have to invest heavily at them, so that everyone can be satisfied. But since there a many stakeholders involved in the proces of putting one in the a area.

But since there a many stakeholders involved and there is a issue with a charging station a user don't know where to go. They probaly just call Municipality of Amsterdam. Maby for a gasoline parked car on a eletric spot it could work. But they can't handle all issues so they have to forward them to the right stakeholder.

So the question is, how can it be easier for the eletric car driver as well for all the other stakeholders who have some sort of control over the charging stations.

### Concept

You got two parts of the concept interacting with each other. Firstly you got the client side.

As a eletric car driver it is really frustrating that something happened to a charing station than literally can be anything. For example a gasoline car parked on a charging station spot (that is indeed illigal), your payment pass doesn't work or the charing station simply just doesn't give any electricity. You can't really complain such issues fast, you have to call a number and wait and share your complain.

Than can be way easier with an app where you can simply open it, find the most common problems with the charing station and confirm or create them. So the issue can be fixed with the right stakeholder who is responsible for their issue. In just a few simple steps based on the information needed you can create a issue. The driver fills out the programmed question answer flow that will ask you for all the necessary information depending on the issue to create it. Also you help other drivers using the app with sharing your complain. There is a big map where all the charging stations are plotted, so people can easiliy see what charing stations currently have troubles.

But by creating a issue it has to go somewhere right? The problem is not solved by than only adressed to the stakeholders. Since most of the common issues are programmed in the client side app we already know what stakeholder is involved with what specefic issue.
With the dashboard there is a shared ticket system where all the stakeholders can login. They see all the open tickets for Amsterdam and see what tickets are currently busy, working on or finished. So when they maby still get a call they easily see if some stakeholder is already working on it or just finsihed it.

### Stakeholders

There are some stakeholders involved, our first point of contact is Jurjen Helmus. We are helping visualising and prototyping his idea.

But in our concept many stakeholders are using our prototype. We splitted the prototype in 2 different parts. On one side you got the client, where the eletric car drivers interact with. On the other side where all the complains come in there are many stakeholders invovled such as Nuon,Municipality of Amsterdam and Alliander.

## Design proces

Before we could even build a prototype we had to map out what features we would like to see in the client and the dashbaord app. We came with the following feautures at first:

##### Client app

**Creating a ticket:**

- Creating a ticket
- Sharing location of the charging station
- Sharing a description

**Status ticket**

- List of your own tickets
- Status for each ticket
- Which stakeholder is involved with the ticket
- Notification when your ticket is closed

- Showing avaliable charging stations on a map

##### Dashboard app

**Tickets**

- a
